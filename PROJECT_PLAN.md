# Project Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for creating an AEP.dev compliant TypeSpec API design project. The project will be implemented in phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive reference implementation.

## New Requirements (Added)

### Project Structure Changes

- **Problem Details**: Implement RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs error style

### Documentation Strategy
- **Centralized Examples**: Declare consts at the top of each file for examples
- **Documentation Tags**: Use `@doc`, `@summary`, `@example` tags throughout
- **Consolidated Examples**: Keep examples in one place, not scattered throughout code
